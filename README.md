# What is static terrain?
A support script which allows **YOU** the players to easily create (fake) terrains as well as interiors for a little known game named Blockland.

# What is the state of this project?
Currently the project is in a funny place as we're limited by the engine and its collsion methods (convex meshes only, benchmarks have shown more than 2000 collisions start to lag both the server and client terribly) and no default performance optimizations exist 
### tldr: we're in need of a fancy dll that'd make a breakthrough in performance otherwise we're stuck with small scale low detail terrains
