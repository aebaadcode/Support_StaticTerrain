TERRAIN EXPLANATION AND TUTORIAL VIDEO
1. the difference between static shapes and tsstatics 
-static shapes work with shaders, are laggy, and use datablocks
-tssatics don't work with shaders, can cast shadows but cannot have shadows cast upon them, good performance, and dont use datablocks
meaning u can have awesome terrain and all your favorite mods enabled at the same time

2. terrain is made from a terrain set aka 1 static shape for visual and X tsstatics for collision 
-the static shape is used for visuals as it works with shaders
-since tsstatics arent datablocks we use the extraresource script to force clients to download them
 
3. why the terrain is made up off lotsa cubes
-cubes are an awesome shape and work pretty well - source uses them for displacements
-cylinders have been attempted but are an akward shape to work with and cause triangular artificats at hill bottoms more often than cubes (3kb instead of 2kb)
-it is unfortunate but collisions must be not only convex but also seperated into their own dts files + scaled by 0.5 for best accuracy
-part of the reason why the og static maps were terrible with vehicles is wrapperup had all the collisions in one file

3. the fake texture blending on terrain
-a 2048x2048 resolution png texture is used to cover the entire map and texture brushed in blender
to create an illusion of it being texture blended like v20
-detail maps do not work for whatever reason so we're stuck with blurry textures
-2048 resolution is used since mip maps dont allow us to go higher (game wont load higher res png and will crash if higher res jpg is used)
-mip maps are important because they sell the v20 look, disabling them gives you an ugly grainy look on the textures from a distance
-using higher resolution textures (can go up to 4k i think) requires disabling of mip maps which causes the aformentioned effect (very bad i will kill u!!)

4. some terrain limitations we have to cope with
-you cannot make loopable terrain since you'll eventually have too many tsstatics spawned at once
-the sacrafice was either having lotsa separate collisions so vehicles work correctly or have everything in one file and because of this
og static maps literally have vehicles like skis instantly falling through the ground - vehicles or no vehicles (spoiler: we chose vehicles :P)
-you cannot have distance based lod like on real terrain - the terrain is always rendered in high quality (bad for performance)
and collisions are always being calculated (no current partical method to load/unload specific collisions when needed though buddy has been experimenting)
-since you must have all collisions active at all times, porting maps like slopes is literally impossible unless you want 1 fps gameplay and 
10k files to download :P

5. some terrain limitations we have to work with
-performance - even with the collisions hidden your blockland can only calculate so much tsstatics at once, 30x30 gives you awesome fps, 
35x35 gives you good fps, and anything higher than that is only going to fuck over lower end users - for testing purposes i tried 50x50 res 
and got a consistent 17 fps max :P 
-player patience - often overlooked but especially makes me paranoid when choosing terrain res - when a player joins a server and sees 5000 files,
they're just gonna instantly disconnect - nobody wants to download that many fucking files, you gotta be crazy dedicated to make it
ive had people baby rage with 30x30 terrain (900 files) that there is too many to download so, keep that mind
the cube collisions are 2kb each (3kb if using 6 sided cylinders) so the download isn't terribly slow, it's just the file count that looks intimidating
